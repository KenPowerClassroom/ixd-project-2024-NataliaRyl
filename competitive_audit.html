                    Is it visually appealing? 
                    Does it have sound and animation to capture the user's attention? 
                    Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</td>
                <td class="good">Kahoot! is a very engaging app. 
                    Kahoot! uses gamification elemenents such as streaks and leaderboards to motivate the user to pick all the correct answers.
                    The app is simple looking but appealing the user at the same time. 
                    The user competes against their classmates to be at the top of the leaderboard.
                    This keeps the user engaged till the very end.
                    The app uses aa repetitive but ear-catching audio to grab the user's attention. 
                    <br> (9/10)</td>
                <td class="good">Blooket is a very engaging app and uses gamification elements such as rewards, leaderboards and the ability the choose a chest which determines if you are losing/gaining money.
                    These elements keep the user engaged as they mainly want to win against their classmates.
                    Blooket has also a time limit which motivates ther user to anwer the questions as quick as possible.
                    The app also uses sound that not only sets the scene for a treasure hunting game but it also grabs the user's attention.

                <td class="medium">
                    Khan Academy has a clean and functional interface but it is not very visually appealing.
                    When completing assignments in the app, there is a challenge element. 
                    Other than the challenges, there isn't much gamification in Khan Academy. 
                    This can unmotivate the student from proceeding to use the app to learn new things.

                    Does it provide feedback and recommendations to help users improve their performance? 
                    Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?</td>
                <td class="good">Kahoot! offers a leaderboard that tracks the user's score. 
                    After each question the app shows the user how well they have preformed.
                    The app shows if the user got their answer wrong/right, what the correct answer is and even rewards the user if they answer the question super fast.
                    These features make the learning experience much more enjoyable.
                    <br> (8/10)</td>
                <td class="bad">Blooket doesn't really offer any sort of progress tracking.
                    All the app tarcks is how much coins they earn from the chests they pick, which is all selected by luck.
                    There is a leaderboard, but it only tracks how much coins the user earns.
                    While the user does indeed get the option to chose a chest to collect coins once they pick the correct answer, it doesn't quite track the progress properly.
                    <br> (2/10) </td>
                <td class="good">Khan Academy excels in its progress tracking.
                    With each assignment the app marks whether its been completed or not.
                    While completing the challenges the user is presented with steps, the app also tells the user if those particulaar steps were completed.

                    Is it easy to navigate and use? 
                    Does it have clear instructions and prompts? 
                    Does it have a well-designed interface?</td>
                <td class="medium">Kahoot's main page is quite complex to understand.
                    It isn't easy to find a quiz the user would like to play.
                    It seems that the app keeps pushing its user's to buy membership.
                    Once the user gets around that and enters a quiz, the interface becomes much easier to use.
                    All answers simple looking and are coloured coded with a symbol for user with visual impairments.
                    <br>(5/10)</td>
                <td class="good">Blooket offers a very user-friendly interface.
                    The app is easy to navigate and use.
                    The Join Game button is in plain site of the app's main page.
                    Overall the simplicity of the app prevents the users getting overwhelmed and exiting the app.

                <td class="good">Khan Academy has a simple look to it.
                    It is extremely easy to navigate as everything is in plain site.
                    There is a good sense of balance with the user being first presented with a tutorial video and then completing a task similar to the video to learn from it.
                    When completing a task Khan Academy uses prompts and hints to assist the user with completing the task.
